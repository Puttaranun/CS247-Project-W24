    "## Low Pass and High Pass Filtering Code\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use signal processing principles to low pass filter and high pass filter our EEG data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The principle we will use is as follows: a convolution of two functions in the time domain is a multiplication in the frequency domain. To that end, we will convolve a low-pass filter (the most basic example being a rect function) with the EEG channels. That is, we will convolve a 1xD kernel of values 1/D over each EEG channel across the 1000 time steps. We will do the same with a high-pass filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: We will pad the dimensions of X such that the output is the same size as the input, which means these will not be true convolutions.  "
